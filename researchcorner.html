            <h1>Categories of Turtles</h1>
            <p>In Sri Lanka, there are five main categories of turtles that can be found along its coasts.</p>
            <h2>Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas)</h2>
            <p>
                The Green Turtle, a magnificent species found in Sri Lanka, holds a prominent place along its coastal waters. Named after the striking color of its fat, which turns green due to its herbivorous diet, these turtles are a true marvel of nature. Known for their impressive size, they can reach weights of up to 700 pounds (317 kilograms). With a smooth carapace that adorns their backs and a comparatively small head, Green Turtles possess a distinctive appearance. However, despite their significance, they face the grave threat of endangerment. Consequently, these remarkable creatures are protected under Sri Lankan law, as dedicated efforts are being made to ensure their survival for generations to come.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Loggerhead Turtle (Caretta caretta)</h2>
            <p>
                Loggerhead Turtles are another species of turtles found in Sri Lanka. They are known for their large heads and powerful jaws. Loggerhead Turtles have a reddish-brown carapace and can grow to weigh around 250 pounds (113 kilograms). These turtles play a vital role in maintaining the balance of marine ecosystems, but like other sea turtles, they face various threats, including habitat loss and pollution.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Hawksbill Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata)</h2>
            <p>The Hawksbill Turtle is a critically endangered species that can be found in Sri Lanka's coastal waters. They are known for their beautiful and unique overlapping scales on their carapace, which is a valuable material known as "tortoiseshell." Hawksbill Turtles play a crucial role in coral reef ecosystems as they feed on sponges, helping to maintain the health of coral reefs. Conservation efforts are in place to protect and preserve this species.

            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Olive Ridley Turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea)</h2>
            <p>
                Olive Ridley Turtles are one of the smallest sea turtle species found in Sri Lanka. They have a distinctive olive-colored carapace and are known for their synchronized mass nesting events, called "arribadas." These turtles face threats such as entanglement in fishing nets and habitat degradation. Conservation measures are being taken to protect nesting sites and mitigate these threats.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Leatherback Turtle (Dermochelys coriacea)</h2>
            <p>
                The Leatherback Turtle is the largest of all sea turtle species and can be found in Sri Lanka's waters. They are unique among sea turtles as their carapace is composed of a leathery skin rather than a hard shell. Leatherback Turtles can grow up to 6-9 feet (1.8-2.7 meters) in length and weigh up to 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms). These turtles undertake long-distance migrations and face various threats, including pollution, entanglement in fishing gear, and habitat loss.
